 The municipal workers responded to a complaint from Dennesig residents about a blockage of one of the sewerlines. After opening up one of the manholes, the workers sighted the decomposed carcass of a puppy along with what appeared to be more carcasses.
They suspected that the puppies were either thrown down a drain, or flushed down a toilet by one of the residents. The municipality was astonished with their findings, saying that drains are more commonly blocked by the flushing of clothes, rubbish or sanitary products.
Ms Prudence Magutle from STLM, said in a statement that the blocking of drains is everybody’s concern. Residents need to take responsibility for flushing obstructive articles down the sewerlines, which result in the spending of tax money to unclogg drains. The municipality has also made an appeal to the public, to help identify the perpertrator who disposed of the puppies down the drain.
