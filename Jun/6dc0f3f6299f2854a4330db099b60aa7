 The campaign is endorsed by Studio88 and Adidas. The 20-year-old finalist from Aerorand is currently in the top 20. “I’ve been obsessed with Adidas since my early netball days in primary school. I love the aesthetics and quality of their clothes. Now that I’m older, I
understand their brand a bit more and I feel like I embody ‘Impossible is Nothing’. In 2015 I was chosen for the U/19 SA Netball Team when all the odds were against me. I believe ‘Impossible is Nothing’ is about resilience and perseverance and those are two qualities I try to live every day”. Thando believes she could be a great example to young people in Middelburg, “Through this competition I can show them that you can come from a small town but still pursue great things”.
