 Sbusiso Thela and Wishgift Mahlangu were chosen to represent the province after they represented the Nkangala District at the Provincial Chess Tournament held in Middelburg at the Eastdene Community Hall at the beginning of June. They will be travelling to Durban to compete on a national level from 30 June to 5 July. Chess coach Lesiba Digangwane said that the boys have worked hard and persevered through difficult times and he is proud to see them be rewarded for it. The principal of the school, T.P. Vilakazi, said that she is proud to be part of the school after it performed well academically during the 2018 grade 12 exams, as proven by their more than 80% pass rate. Another learner, Sithole Mbali, competed in the 200m and 100m events on a provincial level, and the u/17 netball team were crowned champions in the District Premier League in May. Mrs Vilakazi says that the school’s success is due to the hard work of students, teachers and a supportive Student Governing Body.
