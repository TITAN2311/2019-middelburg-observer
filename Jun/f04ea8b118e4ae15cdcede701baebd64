 Two incidents took place in a series of months where a boy, Lieten Jankowitz, and three girls, Mandy Roberts, Neilien Botha and a third girl who wished to remain anonymous, were robbed and threatened at knifepoint. Lieten Jankowitz, a HTS Middelburg learner, was robbed at the corner of Viljoen- and Zuidstreet after leaving school. A knife was held against the boy’s throat while his phone was being taken from his pockets. A similar incident took place in the Lions Park where three Kanonkop High girls were attacked and robbed while walking home after taking their exams. The children were robbed in broad daylight, in a public space which is meant to be a safe play area for children. •Captain Khanyisile Zwane said in a previous statement that children should walk in large groups and keep their valuables hidden from view, to prevent these crimes from taking place.
