 The race will return to eMalahleni for the second year on 24 August 2019. The race finish will move back to Middelburg in 2020/21 and continue in a two-year rotational basis going forward. In an effort to resolve the traffic congestion at the Witbank Dam experienced in 2018, race organisers have introduced a Park and Ride Shuttle bus service this year. Participants and spectators will park safely at Witbank High School & Laerskool Taalfees together with additional limited parking at WH de Klerk School. Cost is R20 per vehicle. The shuttle bus fee (R30pp) is already included in the entry fee to participants but spectators can purchase transport tickets on race day at the bus point. The 32km race will start in Middelburg near Nkangala District Municipality in Walter Sisulu street at 7:00, travelling along the R555, through eMalahleni town and past the Ridge Casino to the dam. The 15km race will also start at 7:00 from Plot 85, eMalahleni and following the same route. The 4.9KM fun run and team run will be in and around the dam area with a few route improvements from 8:00. All the races will end around 13:00. The aim is to have as little as possible disruptions on the roads by making use of a moving road closure.
