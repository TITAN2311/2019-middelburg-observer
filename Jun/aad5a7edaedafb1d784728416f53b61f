 The woman, who lives alone since her husband’s passing, was overpowered by a male attacker this afternoon, who allegedly tried to rob her and sexually assault her. The lady managed to escape from her own home and ran infront of her neighbour’s vehicle. The neighbour, who wishes to remain anonymous, tried to go after the man but could not apprehend him. Photos of the attacker fleeing, while covering his face were shared on community safety groups via whatsapp.  The neighbour told www.mobserver.co.za that she was bound so tightly that he struggled for nearly fifteen minutes to free her. The attacker had stuffed her mouth with pieces of curtain and tied her hands with an electrical cord and material. She was severely traumatised after the incident and her hands were wounded by the scythe that the attacker had on him. The bystanders rushed her to hospital and it is currently unknown what condition she is in. According to the first people at the scene, there was no sign of forced entry to the home. While the victim is receiving medical treatment, her attacker is still at large and residents are urged to report any sightings of him to the police.
