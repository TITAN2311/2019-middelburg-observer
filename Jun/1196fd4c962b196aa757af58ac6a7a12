 During the trial, the court heard how Mpho Mogwerane(38) and Alfred Mmakolo(35) entered a store on 27 September 2017, carrying a weapon and ordered everyone, staff and customers alike, into the kitchen where they locked them up. The accused then proceeded to rob the hostages of their cellphones and stole cash before fleeing the scene.
The duo were tracked down and arrested the same day. Mogwarane and Mmaloko were each sentenced to 13 years for robbery, 13 years for carrying an unlicenced firearm and ammunition and five years for each of the eight counts of kidnapping. The sentences will run concurrently. General Zuma commended the investigative team for their outstanding work, hoping that the sentences will serve as a deterrent to other would-be criminals.
