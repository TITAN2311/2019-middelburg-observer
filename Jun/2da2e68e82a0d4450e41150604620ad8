 Shoppers at the Tosca Centre not only enjoyed a spectacle but also had a bit of a traffic jam after a cattle herder congested the roads with his bovines in persuit. The Middelburg SPCA and traffic department were first at the scene, where they escourted the cattle with blue lights and all, down Sering Street.
Authorities scattered around, trying to prevent the livestock from running into traffic when they arrived at the Stoffberg road. We are not sure where the herder comes from, or where he’s going, but we’re sure he got a ticket. Maybe cow patts are on the menu for this evening.
