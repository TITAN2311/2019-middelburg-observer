Zinhle Maditla (24), handed herself over to the police on 30 December 2018, after the decomposing bodies of her four children were discovered in the room she was renting at the time. The young mother, whose trial kicked off on Monday, 9 September, quietly sat in court as a detailed statement was read out to the Magistrate, explaining how she took the lives of her two girls and two boys.  Maditla had confessed to using rat poison on her four children, Minenhle (8), Blessing (6), Shanique (4) and Ettiene (11 months) and allegedly motivated her crime by stating that the father of her youngest two, failed in his duty as a parent. Her reason for taking the life of her own flesh and blood was that the father had found himself another girlfriend and never bought the children clothes or Christmas presents. Image: Witbank News. According to National Prosecuting Authority, Monica Nyuswa, Maditla asked for the court’s mercy, claiming that she had taken some of the rat poison herself at the time of the murders.
