The drug bust was spearheaded by SANEB and Middelburg K9 Unit. Thabang Dube (29) and Given Choma (28) were travelling in a Toyota Quantum when the SANEB and the K9 Unit pulled them over on the Hendrina Road (N11).
Hawks spokesperson, Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi, said the case was postponed for a formal bail hearing.
