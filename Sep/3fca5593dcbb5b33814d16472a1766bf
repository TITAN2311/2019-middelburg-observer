In a collaborated effort, Cowley Anti poaching, Saving the Survivors and Nolan Landman from the Witbank Veterinary Hospital, successfully helped dart one of the rhinos and fit the bull with a cutting edge tracking device.  Mr Deon Cornelius, owner of Ubhetyan-O-Africa, explained how their new initiative will hopefully protect their beloved rhinos from poaching, as well as keeping track of their whereabouts.
