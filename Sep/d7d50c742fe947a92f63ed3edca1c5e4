The new and improved store, will be officially opening tomorrow with a sentimental ribbon ceremony and plenty of specials to welcome their eager shoppers. Since the Wonderpark Spar’s renovations, their upgrades now offer ample amounts of parking (including underground parking), travelators – which are a first for Middelburg and a store so beautifully embellished, that Head Office has audaciously labelled it as one of the top Spars in the country. To join in on Wonderpark Superspar’s opening celebrations, the Middelburg Observer will be hosting a Facebook Live tomorrow bright and early, where readers and watchers can find out more information on what is to offer at the outstanding Superspar!
