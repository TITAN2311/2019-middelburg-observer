Mr Inacio Rafael Sumbani, a Mozambican national, was found floating in the channel on 2 September, by members of the Department of Water and Sanitation, during one of their routine inspections. The members alerted a security response officer from Gunmar Security, who dispatched the Police. It has been suspected that the deceased slipped into the channel and drowned, but the Police are busy conducting an inquest to determine the cause of death.
