 The tournament kicked off on Sunday, seeing young pool champs from right across the country, all flooding into Middelburg. The tournament is only for young pool players, where teams who fall under the u/18 categories as well as the u/23 categories are allowed to take part. A Western Cape youth development program known as Pool 4 Change is also paying the tournament a visit, where they are showing support to a WP team, groomed by themselves, all of whom have afforded Springbok colours. Mr Donavan Johnson, PRO and Trustee of Pool 4 Change, stated that the Organisation aims at breaking down the stigma that pool is a bar sport. Since their establishment in January, they have seen a great interest on a national scale, and soon hope to birth more pool academies at disadvantaged schools. Johnson stated that South Africaâ€™s more impoverished communities have been infested with drug and alcohol abuse, and crime and that Pool 4 Change will not only provide extramural activities for the younger generation, but that it will also enforce discipline, respect and hard work. The tournament will continue until Friday and will be followed by a prize giving for the winning teams.
