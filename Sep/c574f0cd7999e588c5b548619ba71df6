 People who have the true spirit of Africa burning in their chests, are now publicly announcing the 101 reasons why they are staying in South Africa.
With so much attention given to the negative outlooks on our country, it’s a nice change. The very diverse town of Middelburg has plenty of its own reasons why we should stop reasoning that immigration is the only option.
Three very honest and reliable car guards are just one of them. Not too long ago, www.mobserver.co.za covered a story on Joseph Msiza, a car guard at the Imbali Shopping Centre, who handed over a wallet with over R3 500 in it, five days after the owner lost it. Joseph Msiza at his post. Two weeks later, another resident came forward to share a similar, very encouraging, story. Mr and Mrs Austin went shopping at The Oaks Centre in Lilian Ngoyi Street. Upon their arrival, Mr Austin’s cellphone fell out in the parking area, without him noticing, and the couple went into Clicks. The next thing, friends of theirs called them to alert the Austins that a couple of car guards were looking for them. Thabo Godfrey Maphanga and Alex Dlamini, both guards at the centre, had picked up the lost cellphone and proceeded to redial the last called number. Ms Austin, who was celebrating her birthday on the day, explained what a pleasant surprise it was to have their belongings returned to them.
She explained that it was like a birthday present from someone she didn’t know. The Austins know Thabo through their visits to the centre and laud him for his friendliness. “He always ensures I safely enter the building when I visit the centre.” The Austin couple wishes to thank Thabo and Alex for their act of kindness and awarded them with a gift for their honesty. #I’mStaying.
