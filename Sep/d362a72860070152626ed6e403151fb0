 The Ehlanzeni Diving Unit from the Lowveld sent down two of their unit members who are currently fine-combing through the dam’s silt in hope of retrieving the piece of evidence that is related to a robbery in 2015. The search has moved onto its second day after the suspect in a robbery told police that he had ditched the weapon, which had been used in an armed robbery.
The two divers had barely entered the water, when already, they managed to pull out a home-made knife from the water. According to information, the Mpumalanga Diving Units came second in the financial year of 2018, for the most weapons retrieved from diving searches, nationwide. Every inch of the dam has to be searched by hand, infiltrating years of sediment and the search will take its time. •Read more about the story in this week’s issue of the Middelburg Observer.
