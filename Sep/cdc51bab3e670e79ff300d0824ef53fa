Police dispersed them from the N11 at about 08:00 allowing traffic to flow.  Picketers then blocked the entrance to Choppies Superstore.  They demanded the Choppies management to withdraw an interdict it obtained against its members.  It was not immediately clear what the interdict is about. The group of picketers  prevented Choppies employees from entering the premises.  At about 09:30 the picketers marched to several other companies in the Industrial Park, demanding that the companies employ local residents.
