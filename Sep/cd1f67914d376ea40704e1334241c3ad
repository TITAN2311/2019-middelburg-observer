 This comes after the appointment of Raubex Construction as the official contractor for the extensive project. This 17km stretch of the N4 Toll Route was originally built as a concrete road and currently has an asphalt overlay. Major rehabilitation and expansion works will include the removal and replacement of failed concrete slabs and thereafter the overlaying of the entire section. In addition, seven kilometers of passing lanes will be constructed. The project is valued at approximately R300-million and is expected to take 12 months to complete. It is one of the several major upgrades and rehabilitation projects currently being done along the route. The main reason behind the roadworks is to ensure that the infrastructure of the N4 Toll Route remains on par with international standards and is in line with TRACâ€™s mandate as the concessionaire of the road linking South Africa and Mozambique. Road users are advised that during the month of November 2019 traffic flow will be affected as lane reductions and deviations will be in effect. This may result in delays and road users are urged to be patient and plan their trips accordingly.
