 Its unclear how the fire started but many spectators of the devastation believe it was sabotage. According to initial reports, the fire started right next to the conveyor belts in the grass and spread onto the mine grounds.
Thick clouds of suffocating black smoke rose into the air as the fire spread all along Optimum’s conveyor line. Fire fighters had their hands full to contain the fire which spread rapidly along the rubber conveyor line. The mine has been out of production for months and only payments to Eskom and security at the mine is presently being paid.
Thousands of disgruntled Optimum miners haven’t received any salaries since November last year. Business rescue practitioners, Louis Klopper and Kurt Knoop, could nor be reached for comment.
It remains unclear whether Optimum’s insurance is up to date and what the exact damages are.
