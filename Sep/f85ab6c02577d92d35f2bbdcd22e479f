 The video was shared on the Middelburg Observer Facebook group on Sunday, where a man in civilian clothing can be seen, sweeping refuse from the back of the van, onto a growing heap of rubbish. The open section of field, next to the Klein Olifants River, already resembles a landfill site as illegal dumpers clearly target the area. DA Ward Councillor, Mr Johann Dyason, who is involved in an active struggle to curb the illegal dumping problem, has reported the incident to the Director of Solid Waste.  The sewer line that runs along the Klein Olifants River, has overflowed into the town’s lifeline, due clogging caused by trash in the systems.
Despite the disastrous consequences of pollution in the Klein Olifants, members of the public continue to dump refuse in open spaces. In the video, the police van is visible damaged in the front and has no registration plate.
It was later seen that the police van’s registration was BTC 540 B. www.mobserver.co.za awaits the response of Captain Khanyisile Zwane, the Middelburg Police Spokesperson.   Wat ding julle? Posted by Nols Taljaard on Sunday, 29 September 2019
