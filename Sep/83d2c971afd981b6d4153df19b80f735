The notoriously deadly route has been scattered with the truckâ€™s load, which fell off when the trailer flipped onto its back.  The accident has resulted in a gaping hole in both lanes headed towards Groblersdal, which now poses a risk to motorists.
The road is currently being cleaned of debris, resulting in lane closure and traffic is being redirected.  According to police at the scene, the pass will not be closed, but a large drum being hauled by the truck has fallen off, and several large objects are obstructing the flow of traffic. Motorists are advised to proceed with caution.
