 The lady, who wished to remain anonymous, says she had to swerve out for another woman with a young baby in the car. The woman, who caused the collision, left the scene while the lady who drove through the wall’s husband rushed to her and their kids’ aid. The couple’s car was heavily damaged with some of the wall’s bricks landing on the VW’s roof.
The nose of the car is completely written off. Luckily the woman and her children escaped injury. The couple only owns this one vehicle and will be seeking damages from the woman who caused the collision. The car was removed from the private property by a tow truck shortly before 08:00 after a traffic officer arrived on the scene to assess the damage.
