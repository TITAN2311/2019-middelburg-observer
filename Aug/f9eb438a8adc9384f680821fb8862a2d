According to Centre Manager, Mr Mike Tammadge, the burglars used a crowbar to break into Incredible Connectionâ€™s front door.
They entered the shop and targeted the laptop and cell phone displays. They were inside for less than two minutes. Security guards on duty followed the burglars who gave them the slip. The value of the stolen goods is unknown.
