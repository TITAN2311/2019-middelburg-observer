Police officers and residents rushed out of the station when they realised there was a funny smell of cables burning inside the building.  The fire brigade was called to the scene, although no smoke was detected. The fire brigade is currently observing the scene while the electricians look at the damage.
The hiccup has not halted services.  A table has been placed outside and residents are still able to certify their documents.
