 Brig. Leonard Hlathi said that police in Belfast started by investigating a missing persons report on 5 August. A woman came to the police station to report that her husband and his niece left their home on 4 August and never returned. The vehicle they were travelling in was later discovered in Siyabuswa. It had been set alight. Further investigations revealed that the two missing persons were shot and killed and their bodies dumped next to the Old Belfast Road (R104). The murder was then linked to another missing persons report made at the Witbank police station in eMalahleni, wherein the victim was killed in a similar manner than the Belfast victims. The eMalahleni victim’s body was discovered dumped next to the N4. Police found his vehicle in the possession of a man in Kwaggafontein who alleged that he bought the vehicle from someone else. Information led to the arrest of Collen Lukhele (26), Tumi Vuma (27) and Piet Muziwempi Nkosi (30), who appeared in court in Belfast on Monday. Their matter has been postponed until early in September for further police investigations. Brig. Hlathi said that the three suspects have also been linked with violent crimes in Limpopo. They will appear in the Witbank Magistrate’s Court as well as in a court in Limpopo to face charges there.
