Kanonkop and Dennesig has been notified that the area will be without water on Thursday, from 08:00 to 17:00. DA Ward Councillor, Johann Dyason, has informed that the municipality will be inserting more valves into the older, asbestos pipelines. “As residents well know, some of Middelburg’s suburbs still make use of the asbestos pipes, which are between 40 to 50 years old. These pipes are in dire need of replacement. STLM will be inserting valves to create more cut-off points, so that when these pipes are replaced, smaller areas will be affected.” Residents in Dennesig and Kanonkop are encouraged to store water in containers for the day.
