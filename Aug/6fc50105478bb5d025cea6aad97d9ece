The advertisement has been circulated on social media platforms. Members of the public are therefore warned not to fall prey to such malicious scams as there are no internships available currently nor has the province put out such an advertisement.

Jobs in the South African Police Service are not for sale. Legitimate vacant posts are advertised through the media (print and electronic) as well as the SAPS website.
