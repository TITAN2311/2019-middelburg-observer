 The municipality did not address the colour of the water or reason for the contamination in large parts of the town. Instead, it apologised to residents of Middelburg and Mhluzi for the continual disruptions and inconvenience caused by the reservoir cleaning programme that started on August 5. “The reservoir cleaning programme is being done to maintain the municipality’s Blue Drop status so that residents can continue to enjoy clean and safe drinking water”. During the cleaning of the reservoir process, one reservoir is isolated to minimise the impact on water supply. The completion date for the cleaning of the reservoir serving Aerorand Industrial, Extension 18 and Mineralia is expected to be August 24.
The reservoirs serving Mhluzi will be completed by August 31. SMS and media statements will be issued to residents as and when the water supply will be interrupted. Parts of Kanonkop experienced extremely low water pressure on Sunday, followed by dry taps on Monday.
