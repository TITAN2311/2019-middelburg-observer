 The Freedom of the City Parade will be guided through the town from 09:00 to 12:00, and will include a farewell ceremony for troops deployed to Musina, followed by a long service medal ceremony. According to information provided by the municipality, the Parade will start in Walter Sisulu Street, where it will then turn left into Wanderers Avenue, past the municipal buildings. The Parade will then turn back towards town via John Magagula Street, joining with Joubert Street at Life Midmed Hospital, where they will proceed back to the military base via Dr Beyers Naude Drive. Motorists have been warned that these streets will be temporarily closed as the Parade passes through, but traffic will systematically return to normal as the convoy progresses. Residents are asked to remain patient and drive carefully at these times.
