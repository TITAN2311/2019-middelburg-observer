 There are a few very important things to be noted for this yearâ€™s event. The R555 road will be closed between 6:00 and 14:00 on the 24th of August and will take the form of a moving road closure. Road users are requested to use alternate routes. TRAC officials will be handing out discount vouchers for Class 1 vehicles who are diverted to the N4 for the duration of the closure. There will be no parking available at Witbank Dam. Free Park and Ride Shuttle bus service available from dedicated parking areas to the Dam for runners/walkers. Members of the general public can purchase shuttle tickets at R30 per person on the day at the bus loading points which will run from the parking areas.
The shuttle service will run continuously throughout the day until 15h00. Safe parking at Witbank High School, Laerskool Taalfees and WH De Klerk School at a fee of R20 per vehicle.
Please arrive at least two hours before your set event starting time! If you could not collect your number during the week, then you can collect it the morning of the event at Witbank High School.
The numbers will not be at the individual starting points as in the past. Phone 013 2432253 to find out more. Hope to see you on Saturday!
