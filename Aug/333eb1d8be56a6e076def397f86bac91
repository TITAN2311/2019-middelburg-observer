 The women were walking west bound towards eMalahleni around 05:00 when they were overpowered, beaten and raped. After the harrowing ordeal the women ran to the Middelburg Toll Plaza where Trac personnel assisted them and called for ambulances and the police. According to Trac spokeswoman, Ms Solange Soares-Nicholson, details around the incident remains sketchy.
Its unclear why the women were walking on the highway so early in the morning. Ms Soares-Nicholson added that its also unclear exactly where on the highway the brutal attack occurred. The women were rushed to hospital where police are yet to obtain their statements and open a case of rape and assault.
They are both elderly and therefore very vulnerable to the brutal attack. “No one should walking on the highway because there’s no protection for the public on the roads, especially when its dark,” Ms Soares-Nicholson appeals. The Middelburg police confirmed to www.mobserver.co.za by the time of posting that no case has been opened yet.
