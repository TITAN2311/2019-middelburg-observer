 Sheila Seba Graig (44) briefly appeared in the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court on 13 August facing charges of kidnapping. This came after the suspect walked into the Nelspruit SAPS Community Service Centre asking to fill out an affidavit to enable her to adopt the child. When questioned about the biological mother, Graig presented a signed affidavit attributed to the mother who is based in Bellville, Cape Town. After questioning, the suspect gave a contact number which was subsequently answered by a man who ended the call when he heard it was the police. The case has been referred to the Hawks Serious Organised Crime Investigation team, whose investigations revealed  that the child had been abducted after birth at the Bellville Hospital, by a woman who pretended to be a relative of the mother. The infant has since been taken to a place of safety while investigations continue. Sheila Graig is facing charges of contravening the trafficking in persons act and will appear in court on 20 August for a formal bail application.
