 A video taken by a Middelburg resident soon spread like wildfire, showing a man in overalls sweeping refuse from the back of a state vehicle. In the video, it can be seen that the front of the vehicle has been damaged and does not have a registration plate. Only the rear number plate is visible.  As the resident approaches, the man in overalls nonchalantly continues dumping rubbish into the field in Zuid Street, a few kilometres away from the Police Garage. After circulation, DA Ward Councillor Johann Dyason, reported the incident to the Director of Solid Waste and the police opened up an investigation.

Hlathi told www.mobserver.co.za that the vehicle was being repaired at the time of the incident, following an accident.
He added that a case of illegal use of a state vehicle has been opened. “The vehicle was booked into the Police Garage on 5 September and was then outsourced to an external service provider on 18 September for repair. The vehicle was in the possession of the service provider when the video surfaced.” Brig. Hlathi did not want to name the external company who was repairing the vehicle, saying that an ongoing investigation into the matter is underway. He added that the Police wish to send out a stern warning to members of the public, as well as any service providers, that use of state vehicles without permission is a crime. “We also want to warn members of the public that when you observe an act of crime being committed by officers of the law, do not circulate videos, but report it directly to the police. In this instance, the police were implicated in a crime they did not commit and speculations arose, tarnishing the reputation of the SAPS.”
