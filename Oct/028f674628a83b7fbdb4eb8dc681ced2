At around 13:30 yesterday afternoon, Eskom experienced a fault in the 400kV Gumeni transmission line, connecting to the Hendrina Power Station, resulting in four units tripping.
The units were systematically switched back on and it is expected to take 48 hours for them to reconnect to the grid. According to Juanita Vogel, Eskom Media Spokesperson, there will be no planned loadshedding despite the systems being severely constrained and vulnerable. Eskom is currently making use of their emergency reserves and electricity has been fully restored to neighbouring towns. Eskom continues to appeal to members of the public to use electricity sparingly, while an investigation into the fault is currently underway.
