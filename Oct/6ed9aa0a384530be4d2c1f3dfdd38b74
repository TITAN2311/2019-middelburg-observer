 According to information from Hendrina Police spokesperson W.O. David Mbenekasi, the first incident occurred at 01:00 on Wednesday. A new shape red BMW stopped next to the truck and threw a petrol bomb into the cab through an open window whilst the driver was sleeping inside.  The driver managed to escape unscathed and had to go to the police station only dressed in his underpants. Less than 24-hours later, at 21:10, a second truck was set alight. The driver of the truck was having dinner with a fellow truck driver and was not present when the fire was started. A source, who did not want to be named, said that two vehicles suspected of being involved in the most recent incident have been identified. They are a silver Toyota Avanza and a white Toyota Quantum minibus.  At this stage, the motive for the incidents is unknown, although the source said that they suspect it has to do with the targeting of companies who employ foreign drivers. W.O. Mbenekazi said that anyone with information can contact Fikile Nkosi, the investigating officer, on 013 293 9023.
