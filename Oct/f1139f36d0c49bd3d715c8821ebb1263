 Residents from Hendrina could confirm, after visiting the station, that the whole plant is currently without electricity.
Several sources have confirmed that all units are currently out of order at the plant. Eskom Spokesperson, Juanita Vogel, confirmed that it was a multi-unit trip. She said that the situation does not affect the current “no loadshedding” status because there are enough emergency reserves available at the moment.
