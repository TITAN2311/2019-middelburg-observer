The collision involved three vehicles on the N4, just after the Bethal off-ramp, when the driver of a Hyundai H1 lost control and drove into oncoming traffic. The eastbound lanes of the N4 were closed for hours as emergency personnel investigated the scene, where seven fatalities were counted at the time.
By 08:00, the fire brigade was still actively freeing entrapped occupants from some of the vehicles, by using the jaws of life.  Information was received that one of the injured casualties, who was rushed to hospital, later succumbed to their injuries. The death toll now stands at eight.
