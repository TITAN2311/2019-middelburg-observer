The two learners were part of a group of three, who were swept out to sea. According to Deputy Station Commander of the East London NSRI, Geoff McGreggor, one of the learners was rescued by surfers, and was admitted into hospital for observation.
After an extensive sea and shore search, including the NSRI, K9 Units, as well as the East London Diving Unit, the other two learners remain missing. It was later confirmed that the missing learners were from different schools in Middelburg, Eastern Cape and not Mpumalanga. The learners were part of the Middelburg Harmony Choir, which was touring East London at the time of the incident.
