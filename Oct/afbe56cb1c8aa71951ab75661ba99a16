The accident occurred on the corner of Leipoldt and Totius Street, when the driver of a bakkie lost control and drove into a mini substation. The substation has sustained severe damage and is responsible for the power outage in the suburb.  Residents can expect to be without electricity for eight hours as restoration work commences. The driver was fortunate enough to escape serious injuries.
