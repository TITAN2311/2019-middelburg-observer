It has been almost a month since the horrific collision on the N4 near the Bethal off-ramp.
The crash involved two Volkswagens and four lives were claimed. The two men, Thokozani Gumede and Jeffrey Mthethwa, who both died on impact, have since been identified and buried, however, the women remain unclaimed by their next of kin. Residents with information that can lead to the womenâ€™s families are urged to contact the Middelburg Police Station on 013 249 1600.
