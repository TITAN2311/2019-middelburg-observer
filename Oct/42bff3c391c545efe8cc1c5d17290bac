 Mr David Wade and his spouse, Lindie, were visiting the area for the weekend to explore the rock faces, when David was brutally gunned down. According to Provincial Media Spokesperson for the SAPS, Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the couple were camping at the adventure farm, when David heard noises on Saturday night.
The young rock climber had a weapon on him and went to investigate, when he came across the camp guards being held up by a group of three armed suspects. According to Lindieâ€™s statement, he had left with his weapon and she heard shots being fired moments later. David was found dead after the shooting.
David had tried to help the guards who were tied by the suspects when he was shot by the armed men. Waterval-Boven SAPS was dispatched and arrived at the scene in minutes, but due to bad weather conditions, the three suspects managed to evade capture. Brig. Hlathi said that a case of murder and armed robbery has been opened, but they have no leads on who the suspects might be. The SAPS calls on members of the public to come forward with any information.
