 The acts of vandalism were committed during the festive season leaving residents disgruntled over the below-the-belt graffiti. D.A Councillor, Mr Hennie Niemann, told www.mobserver.co.za that he received complaints from residents early in December.  As a member of the Aerorand Community Policing Forum, Councillor Niemann and a group of members went to investigate.
Councillor Niemann reported that they found graffiti work mostly in the Pongola Street area as well as the park. Slurs were painted onto traffic signs, dustbins, walls and the rides and toys in the park.  Mr Niemann also complained about the large amount of glass and broken bottles scattered around the play area, stating that he feels it poses as a safety risk to children who play there. He sent photos of the acts of vandalism before painting over them to clean up the area.
