 Hi-Tech Wireless & Fibre have generously sponsored seven new marked bibs to the sales team, who are now branded with the Middelburg Observer and Hi-Tech logos. Apart from the bibs, the salesmen also each received a new pair of shoes, sponsored by Hi-Tech and provided by MB Sports.
The bibs protect the salesmen by making them more visible to motorists. The partnership between the Middelburg Observer and street sellers have afforded them the opportunity to generate money and care for their families.
Please support the friendly team who ensures that Mhluzi residents are kept up-to-date about their community. Be sure to get your first copy of the Middelburg Observer for 2019, available from 15:00 this afternoon.
