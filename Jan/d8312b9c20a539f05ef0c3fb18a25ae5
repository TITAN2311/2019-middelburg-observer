 According to information on the Drive Moz Facebook group, eight young people currently on holiday in Mozambique, took a boat cruise to Inhaca Island on Monday. Members of the group went swimming but were swept away from shore by a strong current. One managed to make it back to shore whilst four swimmers have been missing since 15:00 yesterday (Monday). One of the girls, who resides in Groblersdal, sent a message via WhatsApp saying that the boat that took them to the island searched for hours but could not locate the missing swimmers on Monday. The search was suspended at nightfall. Local residents as well as South African expats have joined forces with Mozambican authorities to help search for the missing four on Tuesday morning. The parents of the group of young people left Groblersdal for Mozambique early on Tuesday morning. The identities of the missing young people are not known at this stage. A former resident of Middelburg, who has been in Mozambique for 10 years, is currently on the island, where the search is being conducted. He said that several boats as well as a helicopter is assisting in the search for the missing swimmers. He said the location they went missing from is well known by locals for its strong under-currents.
