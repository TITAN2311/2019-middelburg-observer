 While the risk remains high, loadshedding will only be implemented if absolutely necessary. We remind customers that loadshedding is a controlled measure which protects the power system from a total collapse or blackout. Residents and business entities  are encouraged to continue to use electricity sparingly. Please switch off geysers, pool pumps as well as all non-essential lighting and electric appliances to assist in reducing demand. Also read: Eskom warns of load-shedding Customers are advised to keep checking their loadshedding schedules on the Eskom and their municipal website, and plan on the assumption that loadshedding will take place. In the event that loadshedding becomes necessary, Eskom and the municipalities will use the published rotational loadshedding schedules. For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website: http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za.
