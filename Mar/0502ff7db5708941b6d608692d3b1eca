 Speculations arose that the poster was erected in Zimbabwe, and phone calls flooded into the office of www.mobserver.co.za. The ANC‘s National Media Spokesperson, Mr Dakota Legoete, wrote it off as political bait, in a formal response. When www.mobserver.co.za contacted Mr Legoete’s office for a media enquiry, he responded with the following statement. “It is purely malicious propaganda. It is frivolous and severely lacks substance, because it does not represent the ANC‘s policies. The ANC remains a non-racial party, who devotes itself to live side by side with all nationalities and build a humane order. We believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it.” Also read: Rugby player: ‘Racist post is destroying my career‘ With election season creeping closer, more and more outrageous slogans of political bait will be airing themselves. Mr Legoete stated that the ANC will only make use of official campaign materials, as can be seen on their website. When asked whether it is allowed for any political party to canvas in another country, Mr Legoete insisted that it was not. “To put up posters in another country, would mean to undermine the sovereignty of that country and its political leaders.” He further went on to state that the ANC strives to always maintain a healthy and stable political relationship, on an international scale.
