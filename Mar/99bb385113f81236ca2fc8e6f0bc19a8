 Sue and her husband Robert Lynn, a British citizen, were attacked on their farm, Marchlands, in February 2017. Nkosinathi Yika, Lucas Makua and Themba Yika face nine charges including murder, aggravated robbery and kidnapping.
The Yika brothers pleaded not guilty to all charges against them. A guilty plea by Makua to five of the nine charges was rejected by the court and accepted as a not guilty plea after judge Lineo Liphoto was not satisfied that he admitted to all the elements of the crimes he is charged with. Robert Lynn, who survived the ordeal, is currently testifying. He resides in Northern Ireland and flew to South Africa for the trial.
