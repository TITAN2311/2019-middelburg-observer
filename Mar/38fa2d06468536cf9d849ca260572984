The 30 year old Little Annie is an Antonov from Russia, Siberia, and is the largest single engine, bi-winged aircraft in the world. She has a remarkable story, because Little Annie is an orphan, who was lovingly adopted by the Hill family. She and the Hill family, have since brought smiles to the faces of children, all across South Africa. Mark and Sofia Hill together with their son Jon-Marc, the Pilot, are giving underprivileged and orphaned children a chance to experience what its like to fly, by taking them for a trip in Little Annie. Today, as the Middelburg Airshow takes off, the Just Love Mission have given selected students from Middelburg and surrounds, a flight with Annie. Take a look at some of the photos:
