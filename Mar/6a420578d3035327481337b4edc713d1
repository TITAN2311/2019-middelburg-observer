 The Aeroclub of South Africa moved heaven and earth to give spectators the first hand experience of life in the cockpit with a phanomenal display of aerobatics. Visitors were enthralled by the running commentary of Mr Brian Emmenis and the exclusive open dialogue between pilots, accompanied with delightfully themed music.
Aeroplanes of all shapes and sizes sliced through the sky with the skills and finesse of seasoned experts.  The swelling hearts of patriotism bulged as professional skydivers opened the South African flag overhead, to the sound of the National Anthem.
The Middelburg Airshow was the perfect curtain call to three days of aeronautical entertainment.  The list of display pilots who delivered their incredible performances is as follows: Jason Richardson; Menno Parsons; Garry Whitecross; Nigel Hopkinson; Jason Beamish; Phillip Lewis; Scully Levin; Sean Thuckwray; Arnie Menegelli; Anton von Willich; Jon Marc Hill; Pierre Gouws; Johan von Solms; Trevor Warn; Deon Raath; Andre van Zyl; Dennis Spence; Simon Cowey; Glen Warden; Mike Weingartz; Juba Joubert; Ivan van der Schaar and Nico Roos.
