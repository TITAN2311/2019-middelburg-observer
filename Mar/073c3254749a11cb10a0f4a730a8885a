 The Ridge would like to encourage the local community and learners from surrounding schools to participate in the event and show their support by making a donation and getting their hair shaved or sprayed. All proceeds will be used by CANSA to provide care and support services to people affected by cancer. Represent your school and stand a chance to win loads of great prizes. The three schools with the most participants will each win 50 tickets, proudly sponsored by Tsogo Sun’s The Ridge. The Ridge Marketing Manager, Marina Coetzee says: “CANSA does incredible work and we are proud to support them by hosting a Shavathon at our premises. We hope to see people arriving in great numbers to get their heads shaved or add a splash of colour to their hair.” The cost of attending the event is R50 per adult and R25 for kids under the age of 12. Scholars in the Highveld region can also look forward to the The Ridge’s latest scholar offer, which includes a movie ticket, popcorn and cold drink for R65, valid from 1 April to 31 December 2019.
