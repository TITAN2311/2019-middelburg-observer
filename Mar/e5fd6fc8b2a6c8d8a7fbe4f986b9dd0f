 Eskom did not implement rotational load-shedding yesterday, but the risk of load-shedding remains high for today as the system is still under strain. Load-shedding will only be implemented if absolutely necessary. Residents and businesses are encouraged to use electricity sparingly during this period. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand. Customers are advised to keep checking their load-shedding schedules on the Eskom or municipal website, and plan on the assumption that load shedding will take place. These schedules are available on the Eskom website: http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za. The current load-shedding schedule for Middelburg is as follows: Wed, 6 March:
