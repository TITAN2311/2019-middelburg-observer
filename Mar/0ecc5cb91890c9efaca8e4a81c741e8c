 An ATM at The Bora Shopping Centre in Pullenshope early on Wednesday appears to be a case of similar characteristics. Warrant Officer David Mbenekazi from the Hendrina SAPS, disclosed to www.mobserver.co.za that the incident in Pullenshope was likely orchestrated by inexperienced criminals. Residents who live near the shopping centre, reported that they heard a bang at around 09:00. Most, wrote it off as a blown up transformer and the incident was only reported to the police by 13:00.

Video footage later showed two men ambling across the street but they were facing the wrong direction and positive identification could not be made. Officer Mbenekazi said that information gathered at the scene does not add up, since the incident was only reported at 13:00 and no case was opened. The ATM that was blown up at the Total Garage on the corner of the N11 (Hendrina Road) in Middelburg in October last year, resulted in the wreckage of the entire store. The robbers who targeted the ATM reportedly used too much explosives for the job and left with cash from both the ATM and the registers.
