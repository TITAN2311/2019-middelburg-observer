 Our unique and rare ability to laugh at ourselves is what makes us such a resilient nation. If we look back, I doubt there’s a single disaster that hasn’t sprouted its fair share of jokes.
And, well, I guess you could say, if we don’t laugh, we’ll cry. In the midst of our electricity crisis, South Africans have once again found humour in their darkest hour. Thousands of memes and comic videos are circulating on social media and if you have something funny to share with us, please send it on. The following criteria needs to be met to share your funnies with us: •The content you share may not be propaganda of war, incite violence or contain advocacy of hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion. You are welcome to share your good natured jokes with us by sending it to sjani@mobserver.co.za. But for now, take a look at what we have for you!
