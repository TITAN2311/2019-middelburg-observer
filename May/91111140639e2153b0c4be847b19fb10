 Traffic in Belville Street has increased sharply since construction on the N11, adjacent to the street, begun. DA councillor Morgan Bruiners says that the Nasaret community were not informed of the impact the N11 construction will have on their lives.
He says that many vehicles opt to drive through Nasaret to avoid the slow moving traffic on a temporary dirt road on the N11. High traffic volumes makes things difficult for the six-person team that mans the school crossing. Vehicles stop anywhere and ignore the school patrol’s stop signs. The crossing is at its busiest between 07:30 and 08:00. Parents and teachers have requested the Steve Tshwete Municipality to erect barriers to prevent vehicles from stopping where they want and to provide some sort of protection for learners waiting to cross the road. Municipal Manager Bheki Khenisa said that the Traffic Department are struggling to keep up with the high population growth in Middelburg. He said that they will meet with the school to come up with solutions to solve the issue.
