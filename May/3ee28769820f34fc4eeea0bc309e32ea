 There are now two shacks with a number of Lesotho herders living there. At the new shack www.mobserver.co.za found three men and a woman residing there. The occupiers say that they farm with goats and chickens while the residents of the other shack farms with cattle and sheep.
According to them, they received permission to settle their livestock on the private property. They also have a number of dogs that complainants fear will be used for illegal poaching.
The shacks have been erected less than 10 kilometres from town. Middelburg cannot afford another full-scale invasion of illegal land occupiers like Doornkop. Municipal Manager Mr Bheki Khenisa said the municipality won’t tolerate illegal shacks, even on private property.
Doornkop was also given back to its rightful owners in a land claim like Botshabelo. The legal owners, however, cannot set foot on their ancestral land due to the thousands of illegal land invaders who threaten to kill them and their families if evicted.
Countless legal attempts to move the illegal land occupiers from Doornkop has failed. The land occupiers live without water, sanitation or electricity, as the municipality cannot supply services to privately owned land.
“We can’t risk a similar situation at Botshabelo, we will act immediately,” Mr Khenisa told the paper.
