Despite today being a public holiday, residents have left the warmth of their beds bright and early, with queues picking up even before the voting stations have opened.
The multitudes of South African citizens, lining up to make their mark are handled swiftly and efficiently to keep the flow going. To those who nominated to celebrate their constitutional right, so bitterly fought for by our predecessors, by casting their vote to make a difference, well done! Here are some great photos of voters drawing their crosses! â€¢Voting stations will remain open until 21:00 tonight, to ensure that there is ample time for you to have your say.
