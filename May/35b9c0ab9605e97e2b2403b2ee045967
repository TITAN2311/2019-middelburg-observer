 Police initially thought that the vehicle, which was abandoned next to the rural road after the driver lost control and rolled the car, had been stolen in Carolina earlier the same morning.
The car was traced back to its owner in Carolina who rushed to the scene after learning that the vehicle had been in an accident. When the owner arrived on the scene where the vehicle was lying on its roof with all its tires stolen, he told police that the driver of the vehicle had permission to take the car.
The car was released to the owner after he and the driver settled the matter between them. No charges were opened against either of the parties. After rolling the vehicle the driver went to look for help.
During this time, the vehicle was stripped from all its valuables, including its four tires. Police did not want to identify the parties apart from saying the car belongs to a Mr Potgieter.
