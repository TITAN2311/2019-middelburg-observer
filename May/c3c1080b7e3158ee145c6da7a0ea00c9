 Mr Andre Janeke was visiting the Olifants River Lodge and was kayaking along its banks when something flashy caught his eye.
A strange reptile with a silver head was writhing through the dense overgrowth of shrubbery along the river banks. Mr Janeke left the safety of his kayak and after pushing his way through the brushes, he noted that it was not the lochness monster, but a leguan with its head trapped in a tin can.
He managed to get up close enough to free the leguan’s head and watched it disappearing into the foilage. Mr Janneke found the incident disturbing and shared a video of the leguan with www.mobserver.co.za. He added that he wished the human population would realise how its killing off its wild animals with pollution.
