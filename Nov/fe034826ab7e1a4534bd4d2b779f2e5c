 Black Friday sounds pretty ominous like something out of a post-apocalypse movie… but it doesn’t have to be. You can benefit from great deals and discounts from an array of retailers and brands whether you are sitting behind your computer or are racing around a shopping mall. We are here to help you maximise your BF experience with a few simple tips that will make ALL the difference. These small hacks can be the difference between scoring the new iPhone versus being stuck with your Nokia 3310. Firstly you need to know what you want to buy, otherwise you risk being distracted like a child in a candy store. A number of South African retailers have released their deals so start comparing and compiling a wish-list. Go to your favourite retailer’s website or check out the Black Friday specials on Guzzle.  Odds are you won’t get everything on your wish-list so it’s also important to prioritise what you absolutely need and arrange your list in order of importance. The most popular items (and best deals) are normally electronics, like TVs and kitchen appliances. There are a number of steps you can take in the week before Black Friday that will help you on the day. Take a trip to the shops and make sure you know where to find your products. On the day there are bound to be lots of people and you can risk getting lost in the aisles. If you’re buying online, make sure you find a spot with optimal internet connection. While Black Friday is the perfect occasion to treat yourself, it can also be a great way to save money later on. Make sure to factor in Christmas presents that you won’t need to buy later in December. Kill two birds with one stone. Normally you won’t have all your must-have products in one place. Make sure you team up with a trusted side-kick to optimise your success rate. Whether that means going to different stores or different sites. With just under a week until the big day, it’s time to start getting organised. Ready, set, save!
