 Attendance numbers have dropped like never before as the centre in Meyer Street was burgled again over the weekend, the second break-in in less than a week, while the damage done during two previous break-ins has not even been fixed. Caretaker Rudi Mbenzi says that attendance numbers have steadily dwindled since the previous break-ins, in which several bathrooms were damaged and the centre’s garage and kitchen vandalised.  The centre’s board, which was disbanded but reinstated by the department of social services, hasn’t lifted a finger to seek financial assistance to fix the state of the art centre.
In its heyday it housed around 80 disabled youths every weekday, teaching them skills, supplying them with balanced home-cooked meals and keeping them entertained. On Monday, after last week’s break-in, during which the main ceilings and bathroom in the house were damaged, the Middelburg Observer received another despondent call from Mr Mbenzi with the news that “this time the fools really wanted to do as much damage as possible”. The centre is in such dire straits that all children were ordered to stay home until further notice. “These children depend on us, we keep them safe and love them, if we can get the kitchen operational they can return, because the majority of them are shunned by their communities and are kept isolated and alone,” Mr Mbenzi says.  Despite waiting several hours for the police last Thursday, the SAPS were a no show. On Monday, the paper flagged down a police vehicle in the vicinity of OK Meyer Street that had visited the scene.
Shortly after forensic specialists also visited the scene to gather evidence. • Residents that can alleviate the centre’s immediate need for food, so that disabled youths can return, can contact Mr Mbenzi on 071 632 0788. All other donations and offers can also be negotiated with Mr Mbenzi.
