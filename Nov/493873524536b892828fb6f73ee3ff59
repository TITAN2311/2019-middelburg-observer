The two trucks collided with each other resulting in one of them losing its load. The lane going down the pass in Groblersdal’s direction has been scattered with large bags containing grain which has caused obstruction for passing motorists.  The pass is open, but only one lane is being used to ease the flow of traffic. Motorists are warned to approach the pass with caution. •Traffic was also obstructed in the early hours of yesterday morning, after two trucks lost control descending the pass. One truck made use of the arrestor beds, while the other one jack-knifed and lost its load of steel, which had to be cleared by towing services.
