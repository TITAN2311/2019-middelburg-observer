 A video of the incident is currently circulating on social media. As not to contribute to possible further trauma for the family, www.mobserver.co.za decided not to use the video at this stage. A sound-clip, taken from the video, describes the horrifying moment when the toddler was grabbed.  The mother can be heard screaming, “Hold on! Here he comes!” before two loud bangs, and someone yelling can be heard. The sound-clip ends with the mother screaming, “Let go of my child!” The video shows how a mother, who was under the impression that her vehicle’s doors had locked automatically, points out a man in the street to her two children. Moments later the passenger door of her vehicle flies open and a man can be seen grabbing the younger of the two children. The toddler’s brother jumps out behind him without hesitation. According to information from a voice note by the grandmother, the man with the knife threatened to kill the mother when she tried to follow him. The matter is currently being investigated by authorities. The family could not be reached for comment.
