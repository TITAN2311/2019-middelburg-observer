 SANBS is calling on residents to donate blood as their blood stocks are running very low. “We are experiencing a high demand for blood from hospitals, and are in serious need of blood donations across the country. Our Group O blood stocks are very low. We are appealing to all South Africans to donate a unit of blood in aid of those who may need blood or blood products during this festive season,” said SANBS Chief Marketing Officer Silungile Mlambo. SANBS said there has been an increasingly high demand for blood in hospitals, leaving Group O blood stocks low. Group O is considered the universal blood group, because anyone, regardless of their blood type, can receive type O blood without risking a transfusion reaction. The SANBS added that it has planned various blood drives with extended hours, and additional weekend blood drives to ensure a stable supply of blood during the festive period. The SANBS is appealing to members of the public to visit the SANBS donor centre.
