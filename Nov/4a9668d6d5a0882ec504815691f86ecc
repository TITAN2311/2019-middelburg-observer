 According to reports, three men targeted Touch of Gold. Two of the robbers were trapped inside the business when someone activated the alarm, setting off gas bombs and automatically locking the doors. A third robber who was outside the business, fired two shots to shatter the glass to free his accomplices.  A shopper who was in Woolworths, was injured in the process. Middelburg Mall manager Mike Tammadge, said that one of the mall’s security guards were held hostage during the robbery. An armed guard followed the robbers after they fled the scene in a vehicle but had to back off on the Bethal road after they produced an AK 47. The person injured in the process is said to have only sustained a slight injury and was taken to hospital after the incident. The matter is currently under investigation.
