 Rudi Mbenzi, the overseer at the centre, who is a man with a disability himself, was left dumbfounded after thieves gained access through the roof and destroyed the whole ceiling, as well as the geyser, leaving the whole centre flooded. Rudi explains how this is one of many incidents, where the public institution, already poorly resourced with little funding from the government, has been targeted by thieves, who steal taps and piping for scrap metal or just vandalise the place out of sheer malice. The vandals gained access from over a wall, where student accommodation is situated beside the centre. As the staff sit and wait for the police, they have no idea how they will repair the centre, as they have no funds to do so.
In the meantime, the people in their care are seated outside under a carport. The centre is flooded with water, with bits and pieces of ceiling floating around. Rudi explains how he is convinced that the trespassers are very well informed. What he finds even more frustrating, is that the centre is equipped with an alarm system that was activated, but that the security company never informed them of the break-in. While staff members sit in large puddles of water, with pieces of ceiling soaking on the floor, the centre only has one toilet to make use of, since the ablution blocks were also damaged in a previous incident. “The people in our care are already impoverished and severely disadvantaged! We are a community centre with an aim to serve our community, but it’s the very same community that is robbing us! One day the people in our care won’t have a home to go to.” The staff members are appealing to members of the public for assistance with the repairs. Should anyone wish to contribute financially towards the repair of the centre, they are welcome to call Fikile Temba, who is a member of the committee, on 072 335 3998, or alternatively Rudi Mbenzi on 071 632 0788.
