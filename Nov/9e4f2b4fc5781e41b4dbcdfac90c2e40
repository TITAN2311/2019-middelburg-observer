 Linda Chuter from Lady Rose Women’s Ministry is one of many people that were spiritually rooted in Middelburg, and is coming back to make a difference in our town. Linda shared her testimony and ministered to a group of captivated ladies. The painting of Francis Loots, anointed artist also from Middelburg, is featuring on the front page of the 14th edition of Lady Rose. “God is working mightily in Middelburg, restoring, healing and empowering the community,” said Marie Weber, one of the organisers of the event. She said that like Matthew 6:33, we should, “Seek first of all, His Kingdom and His Righteousness and all these less important things will be given to you abundantly.” Ms Weber invited residents to join them in seeking the Lord above all things, and to be part of the revival that God is orchestrating in Middelburg.
