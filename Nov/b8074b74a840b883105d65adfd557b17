According to provincial media spokesperson, Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the police are currently investigating a case of inquest and house breaking after the incident. In the early hours of this morning, the resident was awoken by his neighbourâ€™s alarm and found a reaction officer from a security company patrolling the property. The resident noticed the officer was alone and decided to accompany him, as the property was standing empty after the passing of his neighbour. The two men entered the home when they noticed that someone had forced an entry, when the robber lashed out at the resident trying to stab him. He then retaliated by shooting the suspect in the head. Police found the body of the suspect was armed with several screw drivers and a knife.
