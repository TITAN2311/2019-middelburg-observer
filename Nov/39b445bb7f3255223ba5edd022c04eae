On this day, members of the Commonwealth unanimously agreed to commemorate the day to all of the fallen heroes taken by the First World War.  The Memorable Order Of the Tin Hats, from the Gondar Shellhole, celebrated the memorial day with a wreath laying ceremony. Poppy Day was derived from the world famous poem by John McCrae, “In Flanders Fields”.
