Reaction officers from Acsu Security were alerted of the robbery at Lewis after workers at the Lowveld Café suspected trouble at around 18:30. Upon Acsu Security’s response, they found two deeply shocked shop assistants locked in the storeroom, with their hands and feet bound.
The Hendrina SAPS was dispatched, and took over the scene. According to one of the first respondents, a laptop, TV and cash was stolen during the robbery. Both shop assistants were traumatized and couldn’t give any information about the suspects. This armed robbery follows a similar incident that transpired a few days ago, where the Lewis store in Ermelo was also targeted. The staff members at Lewis, Hendrina, were contacted for a response, but declined to comment.
