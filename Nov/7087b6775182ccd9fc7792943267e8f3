 Some of the heinous crimes committed during that month soon caught the attention of national media, resulting in a national address from the president himself, where he delivered sixteen promises to the women of South Africa. As time moved on, those promises and the national outrage soon died down. But an organisation known as SA Women Fight Back, which is comprised of a group of female lobbyists, have all but forgotten the victims or their faces. The SA Women Fight Back Organisation drafted a petition of the sixteen promises made by President Cyril Ramaphosa, demanding that those words be put into action. The Lobbyist group has made its way to Middelburg, where they will march through the town’s streets to hand over a memorandum to the Mayor, demanding that he takes a second look at current legislation. SA Women Fight Back has sent out an open invitation towards residents, calling on both men and women alike, to take a stance against rape, domestic violence, misogyny and gender inequality. Three groups will be marching through the streets tomorrow, from the Mhluzi Unemployment Structure in Extention Six, at 07:00. From there, the groups will merge on the corner of Totius Street and Dr Beyers Naudé Drive in Gholfsig where they will proceed to march into town. Anyone who wishes to participate in the march is encouraged to bring a hat, water, and a sign.
