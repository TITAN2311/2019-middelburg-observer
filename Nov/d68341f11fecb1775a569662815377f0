Concerned residents from the neighbourhood blew the whistle on the owner of the home, informing www.mobserver.co.za that five puppies were dead, and two others in very weak condition. A member of the Middelburg SPCA was contacted, but declined to comment stating that the matter is still under investigation. Video material was made available to www.mobserver.co.za, showing how a weak puppy was lifted from the floor and rushed away for medical attention.
