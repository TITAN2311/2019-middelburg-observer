 According to the report, the Witbank Dam dropped from last week’s 89.4% to 88.9%, Middelburg Dam dropped from 93.7% to 93.6% and Loskop Dam dropped from 91.2% to 90.6%.
The drop in water volumes in the Nkangala District’s major dams is in contrast to the slight increase recorded on average in the listed dams in the province. On average, the province recorded a slight increase from 73.9% to 74.3% as recorded this Monday, 8 April. Also read: Water Wednesday: Dam levels are declining in some provinces while the drought effects continue It needs to be noted that as much as water levels in the three major dams are above 80%, the water levels are lower than what was recorded at the same time last year. This is a sign that water levels are dropping and the public needs to take water conservation and demand management seriously to ensure water security for all. The Department of Water and Sanitation, therefore, urges all South Africans to use water sparingly and strengthen water conservation and re-use initiatives, especially as we head into the dry winter season. It is crucial that we all use the available water wisely to ensure the security of supply for all.
