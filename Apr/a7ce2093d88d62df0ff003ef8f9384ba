 The meeting got off to a smooth start and continued until the EFF’s Lebogamga Masemola tabled a motion that the municipality should publish a waiting list of RDP recipients on its websites. The failed motion did not sit well with Cllr Masemola claiming that ANC Councillors wanted to tamper with the housing process, and thus the secrecy. Cllr Christina Mosoma. Things really got messy when Cllr Poppy Mailela was asked by Council Speaker, Mr Andries Mabena, to leave the sitting for council to vote on COGTA’s decision relating to Ms Mailela not attending a disciplinary hearing regarding tardiness, for not attending a number of formal sittings and committee meetings. Council wants Cllr Mailela expelled and the matter was referred to the department with instructions for a disciplinary hearing to be scheduled. True to form, Cllr Mailela reportedly arrived two hours late for the hearing. Cllr Mailela used the sitting to accuse Speaker Mabena of spearheading a vendetta against her.
Cllr Mailela refused to leave the sitting and security guards were called to remove her. Remaining EFF Councillors made such a fracas that they were also ordered out of the meeting.
