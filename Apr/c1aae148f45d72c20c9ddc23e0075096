 Residents from Doornkop blocked the N11 route with a burning truck and concrete slabs a few hours before the marathon was scheduled to take off. The residents were striking over the lack of basic service delivery and the Public Order Policing Unit was dispatched to clear the scene at around midnight on Friday.
Despite the fact that the scene was cleared by 03:00 on Saturday morning, the start of the race was moved back to 07:00. A motorist who was headed to Loskop in the early hours of Saturday morning, sustained serious damages to his vehicle after protesters threw a brick at the passing cars. The Fire Brigade was escorted to the area where the concrete slabs had to be moved and the fires were extinguished. The CEO of Forever Resorts, Mr Kobus Tait, thanked STLM Mayor, Mr Bagudi Tolo as well as local law enforcement for their efforts to clear up the protest action in time for the Loskop Marathon to continue.
