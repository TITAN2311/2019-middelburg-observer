 The municipality will start rolling out the new 240-litre wheelie bin collection system this weekend by handing Kanonkop and Dennesig residents one free wheelie bin for every household.
Aerorand residents will be notified later when to collect their free bins. On Saturday and Sunday, between 09:00 and 17:00, Kanonkop and Dennesig residents must collect their one free bin at the Environmental and Solid Waste workshops (magasyn), on the corner of Protea and Walter Sisulu Drive. Only wheelie bins marked STLM will be collected and waste outside of the bin, will not be collected. After Kanonkop, Dennesig and Aerorand have received bins the rollout will target Phumula, Thembisa, Aerorand, Lottoville, Extension 2, Reabota, Mathayleni, Vuka, Mountain View, Rockville, Extension 18 and Kwazamokuhle Extensions 1 and 3. A bin collection fee of R9,30 per month will be levied after collection of the bin. The fee is much less than what black bags would cost consumers. People who cannot collect their bins on Saturday and Sunday must collect them during next week at the same address during working hours.Lost bins will be replaced at R560. Collection days will remain the same. Residents can phone Mr Moses Lekondeni on 013 249 7276 or the Environmental and Solid Waste Department on 013 249 7024 from 07:30 to 16:30 Mondays to Thursdays, and 07:30 to 13:30 on Fridays.
