 Motorists are warned to avoid the Arnot/Hendrina Road as well as the Carolina Road after violent protests erupted this morning. An Eskom bakkie was burnt in front of Kwazamokuhle. According to information from an eyewitness, five trucks and one pickup truck has been torched, blocking the Arnot and Carolina Roads out of Hendrina.  The protest relates to mine workers at several Optimum owned mines who have not been paid a salary in months. Coal was “delivered” in the road. W.o. David Mbenekazi, Hendrina police spokesperson, advised motorists to avoid the area and use alternative routes. The N11 was safe to use at 08:00 but the situation can change at any stage. Several trucks were set alight. W.o. Mbenekazi said Optimum mine workers are demanding their money.
