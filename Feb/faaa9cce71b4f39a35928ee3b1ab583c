 A drug addict injected himself with heroin in front of a woman a few weeks ago just before he went for help against his addiction.
It happened at about midday in one of our streets. These drug addicts are standing at robots and our community is still giving them money. Watch the video, you paid for it! Ms Elna Lewis (who was one of the founders of the Oorwinnaars) and Pastor Jannie Jacobs (Oorwinnaars Halfway House for men who are drug addicts) asks everybody not to give them money anymore. “If you give them money, you are indirectly responsible if this person dies of a overdose later,” Pastor Jacobs said last week. If you need help for your drug addiction, call Ms Lewis at 082 556 4467 or Pastor Jacobs at 082 566 1862. •To make everybody aware of the problems of drug addiction in Middelburg and to help parents to know the signs of drug addiction, a special Awareness function will be held on 4 March at 18:30 at Corpus Christi. Entrance is free. For more information, call Ms Lewis. Warning: Trigger alert – not for sensitive viewers.
