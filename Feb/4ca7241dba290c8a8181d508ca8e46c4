 It is alleged that the woman, who is said to be pregnant, planned and arranged for her husband to be killed. The suspects were to appear in the Middelburg Magistrates Court on Thursday, to comply with the law that determines that the accused have to appear in court 48 hours after their arrest.
They will then appear in the Hendrina Magistrates Court again today (Friday). W.O. David Mbenekazi, Hendrina Police spokesperson, said that the woman and her co-accused will be charged with premeditated murder. The identities of the accused could not be made public because it could not be confirmed that they did, in fact, appear in court before deadline.
