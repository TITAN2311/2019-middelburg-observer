 The devestating event, which claimed the lives of four pupils and left others critically injured, shook the core of South Africa. Many schools responded in sympathy and gestured support, but Hoërskool Kanonkop went out of their way to do something special.  The Miss Teen City Counsel, Clarissa Pretorius, took hands with Angels Anonymous, Hoërskool Kanonkop and several local biking clubs to orchestrate the beautiful display. Learners from Hoërskool Kanonkop formed a triangle on their sports fields and were accompanied by a military vehicle, a fire engine and revving bikers.
A prayer and message of hope was shared followed by an interval of silence and the Hoërskool Kanonkop’s school song. Even load-shedding could not dim the lights within their hearts.  Hoërskool Kanonkop would like to give thanks to the following people and organisations for their part in making the tribute happen: 4th South African Infantry Battalion, Middelburg Middelburg Fire and Rescue Eagle View for supplying the drone footage Wheels in the Sky Immortal Guardians Blaze of Glory CMA Middelburg 911 Riders Noizy Riders Local artist, Jan Benadie Angels Anonymous Miss Teen City Counsel, Clarissa Pretorius.
