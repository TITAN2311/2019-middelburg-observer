 Businessman and owner of Infinity Sourcing, Derrick du Plessis, learnt that lesson the hard way. Mr Du Plessis’s wife Karan took his Nissan 350Z to be wrapped in a special tint of gold, to suit their business persona. What he however didn’t know, was the depths of Karan’s love for him. Karan put a few personal touches into the wrapping of the car.
Dolphin Print has definitely outdone themselves with wrapping the car for their loyal clients. Upon his arrival to pick up his car, Mr Du Plessis couldn’t be more, um happy, in love! Red hearts, family photos and inspirational messages like “Happy wife = Happy life” and “Honk if you love your wife,” are written all around his prized machine.
Karan’s ode to her husband has earned a number of honks of approval since Mr Du Plessis had collected his car from Dolphin Print. Mr Du Plessis is the only man in Middelburg driving around with a “love branded” car. Ms Du Plessis also made it abundantly clear that “this car is being tracked by the wife”. At the reveal Mr Du Plessis shot up a few prayers “God let this be magnets!”. But God works in mysterious ways, with glue and lots of it in Mr Du Plessis’ case.
