 The incident took place in 2016. The source who made the video available, said he was doing so now, out of desperation after criminal charges came to nothing. He claims that one person lost his eye after being shot at by security guards, another had a miscarriage and a third had his vehicle irreparably damaged. The incident relates to the allowed area of picketing, which forms part of a dispute by 30 workers about their dismissal after the incident. The security company concerned could not give comment right away, but promised that their Operational Manager would be in touch. The mine concerned could not be reached for comment. The identity of the civilians as well as the owner of the combine harvester, is not known at this stage.
