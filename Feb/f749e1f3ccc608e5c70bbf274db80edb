 According to the latest press release, we are to expect stage three load-shedding for today. From the one angle, that means a power cut from 09:00 to 11:30 but according to the STLM schedule, we won’t have any load-shedding today?
The proof is in the pudding, as they say. Small holding residents on the Stoffberg road plots have complained about a full day of no electricity. A resident, Brenda van Wyk tells of how they were plunged into darkness yesterday from 08:00 in the morning to 16:00 in the afternoon.
At 19:00 yesterday evening, their supply was cut again. Eskom and Steve Tshwete Local Municipality have forewarned on multiple occassions that the roster may change at any given moment.
That is no lie. For now, we’ll just have to feel our way through the dark. •Electricity went off according to the Eskom schedule at 9:00.
