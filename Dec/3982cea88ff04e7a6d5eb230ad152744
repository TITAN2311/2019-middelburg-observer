The system remains severely constrained and Eskom appeals to members of the public to use electricity sparingly. According to the Steve Tshwete Municipal loadshedding schedule, stage two loadshedding will be implemented today. The Middelburg Mall, Twizza and surrounds will experience loadshedding from 19:00 to 21:30, and the rest of the town can expect to be without power from 21:00 to 23:30.
