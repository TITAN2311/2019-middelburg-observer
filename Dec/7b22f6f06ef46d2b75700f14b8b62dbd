Paramedics found themselves at a very emotional scene, whilst tending to screaming patients and crying children, all of whom sustained serious injuries.
The bus which had embarked from Durban to Zimbabwe, carried an estimate of 38 passengers.  Two people were declared dead at the scene, while several others, including a baby, were rushed to hospital in a critical condition. The pass had to be temporarily closed, as a clean up of the scene ensues. Journalists at the scene have reported that a stop and go had been erected, allowing vehicles to share the lane headed in Groblersdalâ€™s direction.  Motorists have been cautioned to make use of alternative routes, or approach the area with caution.
