The whole of Middelburg experienced a blackout earlier this afternoon, as members of the fire brigade rushed to stifle the source of the fire at the substation. According to DA Ward Councillor, Mr Hennie Niemann, certain parts of Aerorand, Mhluzi and Gholfsig should prepare to sit without electricity until tomorrow afternoon.  It was later confirmed that power could be restored to other parts of Middelburg, by switching to other substations. The cause of the fault has not yet been determined and an estimated time for restoration remains unknown.
