The vehicle which was traveling in the direction of Nelspruit, had five occupants in it and had rolled during the incident. No other vehicles were involved. According to first respondents, one of the occupants suffered an amputation of their hand. One of the lanes had to be closed as emergency response personnel cleared the scene.
