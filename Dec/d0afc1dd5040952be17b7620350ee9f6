Faithful to their promise, the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality continues to update the public on their progress. Media spokesperson for STLM, Prudence Magutle, told www.mobserver.co.za that electricity has been restored to Aerorand and Mhluzi, as technicians continue to repair the other damaged feeders. There is still no time frame for when work will be completed, however, DA Ward Councillor, Joss Pretorius, has informed communities without power, that technicians will continue to test feeders throughout the day. Residents without power may experience moments where electricity is restored, only to have it cut off again, as the switch station undergoes repair.
