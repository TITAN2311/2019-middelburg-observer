 The warning advises that people should evacuate in time because the entrance to Olifants River Lodge will be submerged. This after the Witbank Dam sluices had to be opened because the dam is filled to the brim. Jacky Smith at Olifant River Lodge says that they are aware of the warning but that the lodge entrance is situated on a hill. “The river is on the other side of the hotel, there might be issues with the caravan park but the lodge is safe,” said Ms Smith. She says that a low water bridge, that connects Presidentsrus residents living on an island, might be submerged and she suspects that the warning was rather aimed at them. “We are open for business and we are safe with no planned evacuation,” Ms Smith assured www.mobserver.co.za. Several Presidentsrus residents who have to cross the low water bridge confirmed that they will be taking precautions to rather sleep elsewhere tonight to prevent them from being unable to get to work tomorrow. Authorities have warned that residents should be wary of possible floods and not cross bridges overflowing with water. The low water bridge near Kees Taljaard Stadium in Middelburg has been closed off after a sluice was opened at the Middelburg Dam earlier, causing river levels to rise and submerge the bridge.
