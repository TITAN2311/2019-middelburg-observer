 While teams worked around the clock in extreme weather conditions for the last two days, some residents commended their efforts, while others became more anxious by the minute over the damages they have sustained from the 72 hour blackout. According to Middelburg’s Executive Mayor, Mr Bagudi Tolo, the burn out of the substation was of such a magnitude, that despite all efforts, it has been impossible to accurately estimate a time of restoration.  According to the latest information the mayor received, the teams at work will hopefully  have electricity up and running between 15:00 and 16:00 this afternoon. The Executive Mayor also wished to take the opportunity to extend an apology to affected residents, stating that the circumstances are out of the municipality’s control.
He added that the incident could not have been foreseen, but technicians have done everything in their capacity to restore electricity to these parts of Middelburg as soon as possible.  Whilst Middelburg remains hopeful that repairs are complete by this afternoon, DA Ward Councillor, Mr Joss Pretorius has sketched another scenario, stating that the damages to the substation are more extreme than what was thought, and that technicians anticipate to work through the night on the repairs.
