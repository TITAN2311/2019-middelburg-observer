 We know how daunting it is to have to wait for your matric results, which is why Caxton Local Media is proud to announce that we have partnered with the Department of Basic Education and we are inviting the class of 2019 to register and receive their matric results via SMS and USSD. Registrations officially opened on Wednesday, 27 November 2019, and learners have until 31 January 2020 to get their official results. Registering is simple. All you have to do is: SMS your ID number and examination numbers to 35658 or; Dial *120*35658# to register via USSD. Each SMS costs R1.50 and USSD costs are R1.50 per minute (free SMSs and minutes do not apply). Matric results will be released on 7 January 2020, registered learners will receive their results message via SMS and will then be able to view their results per subject by dialling *120*35658#.
