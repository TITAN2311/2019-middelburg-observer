 Evergreen trees have long been held as a symbol of the approaching spring after the long winter at the end of the year. Pagan groups used the branches of the fir tree to decorate their homes during the winter solstice celebrations. Earl Romans decorated their homes with evergreen trees during the Saturnalia, a celebration in honour of the god of agriculture, Saturn, knowing that the winter solstice would mean the turning of the seasons, leading up to spring and new life. The modern use of the tree during Christmas has its origins in Germany. Wooden pyramid structures representing trees were used during plays enacted outside churches on Christmas. The structures were decorated to look more like the trees they were representing. The first official tree used for Christmas and New Year’s celebrations is disputed, with both Tallinn in Estonia and Riga in Latvia claiming to have had the first trees. Both trees were set up by the ‘Brotherhood of Blackheads’, who danced around the trees and then set them on fire. Another legend attributes the tradition of an indoor tree to Martin Luther. The legend states that on his way home he was taken by the beauty of a fir tree and brought it home to share it with his children. He decorated the tree with candles that he lit in honour of Jesus’ birth.
