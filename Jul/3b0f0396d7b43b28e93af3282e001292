 According to a motorist who passed the accident, it occurred around 14:45. The truck is lying on its side on the left hand side of the road for motorists travelling down the pass. The driver of the truck was injured and a minor collision followed after a light motor vehicle struck the stationary truck.  No other injuries were sustained. Although the truck is not obstructing the road, the tar surface is covered in maize, making it very slippery. There is also a fire that started at the opposite side of the road. Motorists are advised to approach with caution. A clean up and vehicle recovery has ensued.
