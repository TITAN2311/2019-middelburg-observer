 Johan Sibusiso Duba told Hendrina police that his wife, Ludes Mario Mazive, left for Mozambique on Tuesday 9 July. The couple resides in Kwazamokuhle in Hendrina. Ms Mazive returned to South Africa on Friday and spoke to her husband shortly after passing through Nelspruit. A call to her phone at 18:00 remained unanswered, something Mr Duba thought was because she could not hear her phone ringing in the taxi. Ludes Mario Mazive’s husband is convinced that something happened to her. When he tried to call again at 21:00, Ms Mazive’s phone was switched off. She has not been seen or heard of since.
