 The R400-million project commenced in March this year and will see 30km of the route, rehabilitated and upgraded to a four-lane carriageway. The entire project is expected to take 36 months to complete and the contractor, WBHO Construction, has confirmed that no delays or complications have been experienced so far. This is good news given that the project was suspended in 2018 due to community unrest. However, months of negotiations between the eMakhazeni Local Municipality, TRAC, SANRAL and WBHO/Motheo JV resulted in the signing of a memorandum of understanding and a nod for resuming the project. In line with the understanding, local communities are benefitting extensively from the project and to date 17 local small, medium and micro-enterprises have been appointed and 220 jobs have been created. Several traffic accommodations have been implemented and will remain in place throughout the construction period, including speed reductions, contraflows and occasional Stop/Go’s to remove old road markings. Road users are urged to visit the TRAC website, www.tracn4.co.za, for regular updates to assist them to plan their trips accordingly.
