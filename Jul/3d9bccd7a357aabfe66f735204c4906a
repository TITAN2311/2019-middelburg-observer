 This year’s overhead theme is The Circus and the “Big Top” is coming to town. The well-known Demi Lee Moore is the guest artist at the tea party. Any old or new teddies are collected and donated towards abused or terminally ill children. The event is so popular that more charities have been identified, and will benefit from this year’s function. They are The Teddy Bear Clinic (for abused children and women), the Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA) Highveld and Solidariteit Helpende Hand. Andries encourages the public to not only donate a soft toy but also non-perishable food, blankets and clothing. For tickets (R120 per person) and table bookings, call Andries on 072 248 9424 or Sherall on 072 677 5733.
