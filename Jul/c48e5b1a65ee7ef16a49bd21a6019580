 For years, Feral Care Friends, an NPO that captures ferals to have them neutered and treated before releasing them again, has struggled to control the numbers of ferals which multiply into the hundreds. Charmain Potgieter, a member of Feral Care Friends, has made it her full-time mission to take care of the ferals. The organisation does not only capture and sterilise the cats, but they also help treat illnesses.
A common feral killer that can be treated is feline viral rhinopneumonitis (FVR), which is an upper respiratory infection. Donations of cat food can be delivered to the Feral Care Friends home base at 9 Joule Street. Alternatively, these donations can also be delivered to any veterinary clinic in Middelburg, as well as at Pet & Pool Warehouse. Should anyone prefer to make financial donations, they are welcome to transfer money into the Feral Care Friends veterinary account at the Middelburg Veterinary Clinic. The funding will be used to help pay for the sterilisation of ferals. For more information on how you can help, contact Charmain on 084 408 8887.
