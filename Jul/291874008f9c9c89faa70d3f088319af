 Two of those accidents took place on Saturday night, barely two hours apart and resulted in the loss of seven lives.
Both, on the R555 (Stoffberg Road). On Saturday, a head on collision took place between the robot at Springbok lane and the Renoster turn off. The journalist who attended the accident scene, noticed a ditch spanning across the road a few metres away from the accident scene.  Passing motorists informed www.mobserver.co.za that construction of the road had started late Saturday afternoon. At 17:00, the workers were seen leaving, and the sections of stripped tar were left unattended and unmarked. The head on collision took place minutes later. On Sunday, the journalist revisited the scene, to find that warning signs had still not been put up.
Several vehicles were seen hitting the ditch at high speed, in broad daylight.
