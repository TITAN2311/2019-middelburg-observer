 When two of Middelburg’s own traffic officials were among the eight, www.mobserver.co.za vowed to keep its finger on the pulse.
The two officers, Simphiwe Nkosi and Zanele Vilakazi, appeared in court on charges of soliciting bribes from motorists. A journalist from www.mobserver.co.za attended their bail hearing to dutifully report on the case, when things took a sudden turn. The journalist, Ms Tiisetso Malunga, who applied for permission to photograph the suspects in court, was asked to take the stand and face the impending wrath of the defence attorneys.
The defence attorney did what he could to break down Ms Malunga’s motivation behind her application.

He asked how their roles as law enforcers was relevant to the public, knowing full well that the media is rightfully inclined to identify the accused once they have been charged. Ms Malunga did well to represent her application in court, on the grounds that she serves in the public’s interest. Her tenacious battle represents the freedom of speech and constitutional right to information, that each citizen is entitled to. If the press can be silenced, so can the people. The magistrate eventually ruled in favour of her application.
